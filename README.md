# Java problems and solutions

This is NOT a complete list of solutions with all design patterns and implementations.
Just only some problems and solutions with JUnit 5 tests.

## Player and Weapon

An implementation of the Strategy pattern where a player uses a weapon.

## Polyline

Design a Polyline class to represent a geometric polyline. A polyline is made up of a sequence of line segments laid end to end on a plane.

The Polyline class will be used in a concurrent environment and as such the decision was taken to make it immutable.

Design and implement a Polyline class ensuring that Polylines are immutable. Provide a method to add new Points to a Polyline.
